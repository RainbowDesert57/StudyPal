# StudyPal
An all-in-one Swiss knife to help you study: track sessions, view progress, and reflect on yourself.

⚠️ *Note:* Development has just started — the first beta will be out in **3–4 weeks**, and adding to that, my exams are ongoing till about 20 sep.
I’m a solo dev, and this is my most ambitious project yet :)
